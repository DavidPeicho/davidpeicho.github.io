    Just before starting my fourth year at EPITA, I joined the <a href="https://sketchfab.com">Sketchfab</a> company
    for a 6 months internship. It went very well actually, and I spent a good
    time working with good people on an amazing product!

### Atmosphere

It is often *hard* to find a good internship, that suits what you like and in
which you can work on something valuable. What tends to make me choose of a
company or another is also the atmosphere that lives in.

I started my internship at <a href="https://sketchfab.com">Sketchfab</a> in
September 2016, and I got along well with every people. Working at Sketchfab was
very nice because you have the chance to meet completly different people, ones
that are very good in rendering, others in backend development, ...

Besides this, everyone is happy to be there, and everyone is glad to bring
some creativity to the product.

### Product

For those who do not know, Sketchfab offers its users to upload their 3D content
on their website. Beside storing the model online, they let them customize it
inside a web-based editor, and share them with the community.

The Sketchfab viewer is actually quite advanced, and has support for several
shading models, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering">PBR</a>.

Below is an example of one of the most liked 3D model on Sketchfab.

### Projects

What made my internship so nice (at least, for me), was the projects I worked on.
I was assigned very different missions, and I did not spend my entire internship
on the same subject.

#### ASTC

I started to work on **ASTC**, which is a lossy compression texture format, that
can be decompressed by a GPU. Unfortunately, **ASTC** is not yet supported by
all the chips, and I was in charge of implementing a frontend decompression
in **JavaScript**

#### glTF

If you are interested in computer graphics, maybe you know what's the glTF format.
**glTF** is a new 3D format that stores scene-related information in a .json file.

Sketchfab quickly decided to support this new format, and I was in charge of
implementing the frontend loading directly into <a href="http://osgjs.org/"></a>,
the framework on which Sketchfab is built upon.

#### SSAO

I went a bit more in the rendering part, by working on a SSAO post-processing effect.
I was in charge of implementing the <a href="http://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2012-06_Scalable-Ambient-Obscurance/McGuire12SAO.pdf">Scalable Ambient Obcscurance</a> effect, which is pretty well explained by Morgan Mcguire.

### Sum up

It was a wonderful experience to be at Sketchfab! I learnt many things. I
wanted to join this company to improve my knowledge regarding the computer graphics
field, but I did not learn only rendering, I learnt about texture compression, 3D formats, ...

Beside what I learnt, people were really nice, and everyone was really involved
in making the product even better!

If you are interested about Sketchfab, or just the 3D world, I can only advise you
to candidate! :)
