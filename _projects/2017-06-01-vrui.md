### Overview

VRUI is JavaScript library helping to create VR-based user interfaces. You can
provide any **THREE.Object3D** used as an input device.

### How it works

It works by positionning elements relatively to each other, just like
*Android Layouts* or *HTML* elements would do. The API is of course poor for
now, and the goal is not to provide too many options but to keep something
simple and clear.

    <figcaption class="markdown-img-caption">Example using a x-aligned UI.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>


### What's next

* The API is still messy at some places, changing this is a priority!
* Some helper function should be created to simply layout creation
* Add paging system, that is for now harcoded in **ArtFlow**
