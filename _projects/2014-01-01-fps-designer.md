### Overview

**FPSDesigner** is a Windows software allowing non-programmers to create their
own 3D FPS game. Users can easily place light props, 3D meshes, and script the
world to add some game logic.

### Features

* Editor
  * Add props: lights, 3D models, etc...
  * Transform props: rotation, position, etc...
  * Add scripting component
  * Heightmap loading for terrain
* Game
  * Multiple weapons
  * Basic physics
  * Skinned animations

### Current status

We were a team of two working on this project, and, unfortunately,
we did not maintain the software at all anymore.

We started working on it with very basic knowledge in Computer Science,
looking at the code 4 years later makes me cry a bit. It is actually
impossible to update, it would be a better idea to restart it from scratch.
