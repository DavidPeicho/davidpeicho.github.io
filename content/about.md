I am David, a Research Scientist within the Visualization Team at Siemens Healthineers.

My current job consists of pushing 3D Medical Visualization capabilities in the Web, mostly using WebGL. My goal is to achieve real-time or close to real-time medical visualization.

My main field of interests in computer science are:

Computer Graphics
Game Development
C++ and JavaScript programming in general!
I graduated from EPITA (Ecole des Ing√©nieurs en Intelligence Informatique) in 2019, where I obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science, and specialized in Artificial Intelligence.
