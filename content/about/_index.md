## Hi

I am David Peicho, a Research Scientist within the visualization team at
[Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/).

My current job consists of pushing 3D Medical Visualization
capabilities in the Web, mostly using WebGL. My goal is to achieve **real-time** or close to **real-time** medical visualization.

I graduated from [EPITA (Ecole des Ingénieurs en Intelligence Informatique)](https://www.epita.fr/en) in 2018,
where I obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science, and specialized in Artificial Intelligence.

My up-to-date resume is available →
