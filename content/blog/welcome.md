This is my first blog ever. It's going to be an extra short blog post introducing me, this website, and why I decided to create it.

Let's go!

## Hi

I am David Peicho, Research Scientist at [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com),
and this is my first blog post!

I am currently working in the Visulization Team, where I maintain our own WebGL
renderer achieving **real-time** or close to **real-time** medical imaging.

If you want to know more about me in general, you can follow [this link](/).

## Content of this blog

I've wanted to create this blog for a long time to aggregate my projects and
post some experiments.

This blog may be quite empty right now, but in the near future it's going to
get some fresh content! I will publish posts and projects that will most
likely be related to:

* Computer graphics
* Game development
* Optimization (CPU / GPU)

## About this blog

This website is built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and
[Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev).

The Svelte framework is nice and easy to use. You can write components almost
like you would write raw JavaScript / HTML / CSS.

Svelte is basically a compiler. You write your components in a file mixing JS,
CSS, and HTML, and the compiler takes care of wrapping everything, creating
**reactive** properties, performing DOM **invalidation**, etc...

If you want a more technical overview, you can read more on the
[Svelte website](https://svelte.dev). You can also try it directly via their
[playground](https://svelte.dev/examples).

This blog is entirely open source and is available on GitHub. If you want to
learn more about how it works, or if you want to use this blog as a template for
your own website, feel free to [fork it](https://github.com/DavidPeicho/davidpeicho.github.io)!

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank two people, without whom this website would not look the
way it does now (mainly because of my poor design skills and taste).

Thanks to [Jimmy Lai](https://github.com/feedthejim/) and to
[Lucy Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucyw1213/) for their invaluable advice
on the frontend look on this blog.
