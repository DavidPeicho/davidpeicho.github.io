This is my first blog ever. It's going to be an extra short blog post introducing me, this website, and why I decided to create it.

Let's go!

<!--more-->

## Hi

I am David Peicho, Research Scientist at [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com),
and this is my first blog post!

I am currently working in the Visulization Team, where I maintain our own WebGL
renderer achieving **real-time** or close to **real-time** medical imaging.

If you want to know more about me in general, you can follow [this link](/about).

## Content of this blog

I've wanted to create this blog for a long time to aggregate my projects and
post some experiments.

This blog may be quite empty right now, but in the near future it's going to
get some fresh content! I will publish posts and projects that will most
likely be related to:

* Computer graphics
* Game development
* Optimization (CPU / GPU)

## Blog Technology

This blog is made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I actually made 3 blogs
quasi in a row, using first React and Nuxt.JS, then Svelte & Sapper, and
finally using Hugo.

I was not familiar with any of those frameworks. I have spent the last few years
working with WebGL, but I wasn't really focus on building web components.

Turns out Hugo was much better for what I wanted to do, and easy to setup and
to get going.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank two people, without whom this website would not look the
way it does now (mainly because of my poor design skills and taste).

Thanks to [Jimmy Lai](https://github.com/feedthejim/) and to
[Lucy Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucyw1213/) for their invaluable advice
on the frontend look on this blog.
