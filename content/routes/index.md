## Hi

I am David, a Research Scientist within the Visualization Team at
[Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/).

My current job consists of pushing 3D Medical Visualization
capabilities in the Web, mostly using WebGL. My goal is to achieve **real-time**
or close to **real-time** medical visualization.

My main field of interests in computer science are:
* **Computer Graphics**
* **Game Development**
* **C++** and **JavaScript** programming in general!

I graduated from [EPITA (Ecole des Ing√©nieurs en Intelligence Informatique)](https://www.epita.fr/en) in 2019,
where I obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science, and specialized in Artificial Intelligence.

## Open-Source contributions

* [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)
* [OSG.js](https://github.com/cedricpinson/osgjs)
* [WebGL](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/WebGL)
