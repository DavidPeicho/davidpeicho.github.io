## Hi

I am David, a Research Scientist within the Visualization Team at
[Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/).

My current position consists of pushing 3D Medical Visualization
capabilities in the Web, mostly using WebGL. Our goal is to achieve Real-Time
or close to Real-Time medical visualization.

My main field of interests in Computer Science are:
* **Computer Graphics**
* **Game Development**
* **C++** and **JavaScript** programming in general!

I graduated from [EPITA (Ecole des Ing√©nieurs en Intelligence Informatique)](https://www.epita.fr/en) in 2019,
where I obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science, speciality Artificial Intelligence.
