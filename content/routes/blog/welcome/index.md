## Hi

I am David Peicho, Research Scientist at [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com),
and this is my first blog post!

I am currently working in the Visulization Team, where I maintain our own WebGL
renderer achieving Real-Time or close to Real-Time Medical Imaging.

If you want to know more about me in general, you can follow [this link](/).

## Content of this blog

It's been a long time I wanted to create a blog to aggregate my projects, as
well as posting some experiments.

This blog may be quite empty right now, but in a near future it's going to
get some fresh content! The posts & projects that will get published will most
likely be related to

* Computer graphics;
* Game development;
* Optimization (CPU / GPU).

## About this blog

This website is built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) & [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev).

The Svelte framework is nice & easy to use. You can write components almost
like you would write raw JavaScript / HTML / CSS.

Svelte is basically a compiler. You write your components in a file mixing JS,
CSS, and HTML, and the compiler takes care of wrapping everything, creating
**reactive** properties, performing DOM **invalidation**, etc...

If you want a more technical overview, you can reach the
[Svelte website](https://svelte.dev). You can also try it directly via their
[playground](https://svelte.dev/examples).

This blog is entirely Open Source, and it's available on GitHub. If you want to
learn more about how it works, or if you want to use this blog as a template for
your own website, feel free to [fork it](https://github.com/DavidPeicho/davidpeicho.github.io)!

## Thanking

I would like to thank two people, without whom this website would not have
looked like the way its looking right now, because of my poor design skills
and taste.

Thanks to [Jimmy Lai](https://github.com/feedthejim/), and to Lucy Wang for
their numerous advices on the frontend look on this blog.
