## Hi

I am David Peicho, and this is my first blog post!

If you want to know more about me, what I do, and where I work, you can follow
[this link](/about).

## About this blog

I am a Software Engineer, but I have never been really interested about Web
development, frontend or backend. At least, it's not the career path I wanted
to follow.

I was wondering whether I should use something like [Hugo](), [Jekyll](), [Hexo](),
but none of them really satisfied me. Don't get me wrong, these tools are great,
but they don't provide the flexibility I was looking for. My last projects
(personal or for work) have been strongly connected to WebGL and JavaScript.
I wanted to create a blog that could easily use any other resource I make, especially
for WebGL.

##### Why not use any static website generator?

1. I was looking for something to run samples on the blog, without extra resources
2. I wanted to use any bundler of my preference
3. I wanted basically to be able to use any tool of my JS toolchain

Again, I am not a Web developer, I don't have much knowledge outside frontend
toolchains, and raw JavaScript. I decided to go for a Component-Based library,
that I could use to generate this static blog.
